Hi, my name is Aina Ruhana. For the assessment I have answered the first question which is to design a frontend website.
I have design my website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The features included are User Registration, Sign-On screen/module, and User Profile interface.
My website is only a dummy website and did not connected to the database.

In the register page, user need to enter their username, email, and password to register. After click on the "Register" button, user will be directed to the sign in page.
User need to enter matching email and password in order to sign in.
If the email and password match, user will be directed to a simple user profile interface.
